# üß≠ Three Generations of HTTP Clients in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates **three different approaches** to building HTTP clients in modern Spring Boot (3.x) using the [`RestClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#rest-http-interface), Declarative Interfaces, and the new `@ImportHttpServices` annotation.

We use the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) fake REST API to simulate user-related HTTP interactions.

## ‚úÖ Overview

Spring has continuously evolved its HTTP client capabilities:

| Generation | Feature | Introduced In |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | `RestClient` (fluent API) | Spring Framework 6.1 |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | Declarative HTTP Interface via `HttpServiceProxyFactory` | Spring Framework 6.0 |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | `@ImportHttpServices` annotation | Spring Framework 7 / Boot 4 |

This repository showcases all three techniques in a clean, comparable structure to help developers choose the best approach for their use case.
